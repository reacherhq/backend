# Licensing Information

This library (`reacherhq/backend`) has a dual license, a commercial one suitable for closed-source commercial projects and an AGPL license that can be used in open-source software.

Depending on your needs, you must choose one of them and follow its policies. A detail of the policies and agreements for each license type are available in the [LICENSE.COMMERCIAL](./LICENSE.COMMERCIAL) and [LICENSE.AGPL](./LICENSE.AGPL) files.

In brief, purchasing a license is mandatory as soon as you develop activities distributing the `reacherhq/backend` software inside your product or deploying it on a network without disclosing the source code of your own applications under the AGPL license. These activities include:

-   offering services as an application service provider or over-network application programming interface (API),
-   creating/manipulating documents for users in a web/server/cloud application,
-   shipping `reacherhq/backend` with a closed source product.

Please visit [Reacher's dedicated page on the Commercial License](https://reacher.email/self-host) to purchase a commercial license or contact Reacher support at amaury@reacher.email for more info.
