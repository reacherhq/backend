# Reacher Microservices

This package holds the Dockerfile that can deploy [`check-if-email-exists`](https://github.com/amaurymartiny/check-if-email-exists) as a microservice to online cloud providers.

If you wish to see the legacy code deployed to [Serverless](https://serverless.com/), check out the [`serverless`](https://github.com/reacherhq/microservices/tree/serverless) branch.
