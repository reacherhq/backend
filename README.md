# ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT UPDATE ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

This repo has been moved to the monorepo [reacherhq/check-if-email-exists](https://github.com/reacherhq/check-if-email-exists), in the `backend` subfolder.

## Reacher Backend

This repository holds the backend for [Reacher](https://reacher.email). The backend is a HTTP server with the following components:

-   [`check-if-email-exists`](https://github.com/reacherhq/check-if-email-exists), which performs the core email verification logic,
-   [`warp`](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp) web framework.

## Get Started

There are 2 ways you can run this backend.

### 1. Use Docker

The [Docker image](./Dockerfile) is hosted on Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/reacherhq/backend.

To run it, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 reacherhq/backend
```

You can then send a POST request with the following body to `http://localhost:8080/v0/check_email`:

```js
{
	"to_email": "someone@gmail.com",
	"from_email": "my@my-server.com", // (optional) email to use in the `FROM` SMTP command, defaults to "user@example.org"
	"hello_name": "my-server.com",    // (optional) name to use in the `EHLO` SMTP command, defaults to "localhost"
	"proxy": {                        // (optional) SOCK5 proxy to run the verification through, default is empty
		"host": "my-proxy.io",
		"port": 1080
	},
	"smtp_port": 587                  // (optional) SMTP port to do the email verification, defaults to 25
}
```

### 2. Run locally

If you prefer to run the server locally on your machine, just clone the repository and run:

```bash
cargo run
```

The server will then be listening on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

### Configuration

These are the environment variables used to configure the HTTP server:

| Env Var                             | Required?                   | Description                                                                                                | Default            |

## REST API Documentation

Read docs on https://help.reacher.email/rest-api-documentation.

The API basically only exposes one endpoint: `POST /v0/check_email` expecting the following body:

```js
{
	"to_email": "someone@gmail.com",
	"from_email": "my@my-server.com", // (optional) email to use in the `FROM` SMTP command, defaults to "user@example.org"
	"hello_name": "my-server.com",    // (optional) name to use in the `EHLO` SMTP command, defaults to "localhost"
	"proxy": {                        // (optional) SOCK5 proxy to run the verification through, default is empty
		"host": "my-proxy.io",
		"port": 1080
	},
	"smtp_port": 587                  // (optional) SMTP port to do the email verification, defaults to 25
}
```
